# Hospital Universal Manager
An application designed to manage all aspects of day-to-day operations in a hypothetical hospital, including patient and staff information record-keeping, medical record-keeping, service/appointment booking, and transactional book-keeping.

This project is a revitalized version of a project done for course CPSC 304 (Relational Databases) at The University of British Columbia. 

Application created in collaboration with [Cecilia Mesquita](https://github.com/ceci96p). 

### To-do
1. Build application into a single .jar using Maven. 
2. Fix "Patients scheduled for all services" query under the Staff View.
